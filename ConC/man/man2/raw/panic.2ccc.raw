.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Panic
will print the character string
.I message
on stdout, dump the machine registers and top few stack locations,
and exit.
It uses
.I kprintf
rather than

so it may be called anywhere in
the kernel (e.g., from an interrupt routine that may be executed
by the null task).
.SH SEE ALSO
kprintf(DEBUG), printf(3)
