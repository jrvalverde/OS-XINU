.TH SCOUNT 2CCC
.SH NAME
scount \- return the count associated with a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B s =  scount(sem)
.B int s;
.B int sem;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Scount
returns the current count associated with semaphore
.I sem.
If
.I sem
is invalid, -1 is returned and errno is set to CEBADSEM.
A count of negative s means that there are s tasks waiting
on the semaphore; a count of positive s means that at most s more
calls to swait() can occur before a task will be blocked (assuming
no intervening ssignals occur).
.SH SEE ALSO
screate(2CCC), sdelete(2CCC), ssignal(2CCC), sreset(2CCC), swait(2CCC)
.SH BUGS
The error return value of -1 is
a legal semaphore count.  The indication that an actual error occurred is
given in errno.  For this reason, errno is set to
zero inside
.I scount
if no error occurred.  This is in opposition with the convention
of system calls not reseting errno.
