.SH DESCRIPTION
In either form,
.I sleep
causes the current task to delay for a specified time and then
resume.
The form
.I sleep
expects the delay to be given in an integral number of seconds;
it is most useful for longer delays.
The form
.I sleep10
expects the delay to be given in an integral number of 1/10
seconds; it is most useful for short delays.
.PP
Sleeping is not the same as hibernation (see SUSPEND(2CCC)).
In particular, sleeping tasks cannot be awakened until they
time out.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Both forms return -1 and errno is set to EINVAL if the argument is negative.
Otherwise they delay for the specified time and return 0.

.SH BUGS
The maximum sleep is 32767 seconds (about 546 minutes, or 9.1 hours).
Sleep guarantees a lower bound on delay, but since the system may
delay processing of
interrupts at times, sleep cannot guarantee an upper bound.
