.TH TKILL 2CCC
.SH NAME
tkill \- terminate a task
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int
.B tkill(tid)
.br
.B int tid;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tkill
will stop task
.I tid
and remove it from the system.
.I Tkill
terminates a task immediately.
If the task has been queued on a semaphore, it is removed from
the queue and the semaphore count is incremented as if the
task had never been there.
Tasks waiting to send a message to a full port disappear without
affecting the port.
.PP
One can kill a task in any state, including a suspended one.
Once killed, a task cannot recover.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If successful,
.I tkill
returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and errno is set to CEBADTID.
.SH BUGS
At present there is no way to recover space allocated dynamically
when a task terminates.
However,
.I tkill
does recover the stack space allocated to a task when it is created.
