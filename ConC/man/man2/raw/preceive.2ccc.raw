.SH SYNOPSIS

.B char *preceive(portid)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Preceive
retrieves the next message from the port
.I portid,
returning a pointer to the message if successful.
If
.I portid
is invalid, the null pointer is returned and errno is set to CEBADPT.
(The sender and receiver
must agree on a convention for passing the message length.)
.PP
The calling task is blocked if there are no messages
available (and reawakened as soon as a message arrives).
The only ways to be released from a port queue are for
some other task to send a message to the port
with psend(2CCC)
or
for some other task to delete
or reset
the port with pdelete(2CCC) or preset(2CCC).
