.SH NAME
create \- create a new task
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tid = create(caddr,ssize,prio,name,nargs[,argument]*)
.nf
.B int tid;
.B char *caddr;
.B int ssize;
.B int prio;
.B char *name;
.B int nargs;
.B long argument;	/* actually, type "machine word" */
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Create
creates a new task that will begin execution at location
.I caddr,
with a stack of
.I ssize
words, initial priority
.I prio,
and identifying name
.I name.
.I Caddr
should be the address of a procedure or main program.
The created task is left in the suspended state; it will
not begin execution until started by a resume command.
The new task has its own stack, but shares global data
with other tasks according to the scope rules of C.
If the procedure attempts to return, its
task will be terminated (see TKILL(2CCC)).
.PP
The caller can pass a variable number of arguments to the created
task which are accessed through formal parameters.
The integer
.I nargs
specifies how many argument values follow.
.I Nargs
values from the
.I arguments
list will be passed to the created task.
The type and number of such arguments is not checked; each
is treated as a single machine word.
The user is cautioned against passing the address of any dynamically
allocated datum to a task because such objects may be deallocated
from the creator's run-time stack even though
the created task retains a pointer.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the creation is successful, the (nonnegative) task id of
the new task is returned to the caller.
If the arguments are incorrect, or if there are no free task
slots, the value -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 15
[CENOTASK]
Task table is full.  No more tasks allowed.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
Invalid argument.
.TP 15
