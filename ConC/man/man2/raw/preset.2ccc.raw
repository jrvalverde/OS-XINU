.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B int preset(portid, dispose)
.B int portid;
.B int (*dispose)();
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Preset
flushes all messages from a port and releases all tasks waiting to
send or receive messages.
.I Preset
returns -1 and errno is set to CEBADPT if
.I portid
is not a valid port id.
.PP
.I Preset
has several effects, depending on the state of the port at the
time the call is issued.
If tasks are blocked waiting to receive
messages from port
.I portid,
they are all made ready; each returns -1 to caller.
If messages are in the port they are disposed of by passing them
to function
.IR dispose .
If tasks are blocked waiting to send messages
they are made ready; each returns -1 to its caller
(as though the port never existed).
.PP
The effects of 
.I preset
are the same as
.I pdelete,
followed by
.I pcreate,
except that the port is not deallocated.
The maximum message count remains the same as it was.
.SH SEE ALSO
pcount(2CCC), pcreate(2CCC), pdelete(2CCC), preceive(2CCC), psend(2CCC)
.SH BUGS
There is no way to change the maximum message count when the port is
reset.
