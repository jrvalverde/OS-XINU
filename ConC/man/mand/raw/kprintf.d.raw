.SH DESCRIPTION
In either form,
.I kprintf
writes formatted output to stdout without buffering the result.
It does this while having interrupts disabled, so it can be called
anywhere in a user's program or as a debugging aid for ConcurrenC
system routines.
.PP
The form
.I kprintf
is for the main process of the ConcurrenC system, while
.I kprint_serv
is for the io_server process.  These are different because different
interrupts are disabled in each.
.SH SEE ALSO
printf(3S) of the UNIX man pages
.SH BUGS
There is a maximum length of 1000 characters which can be printed out
at one time.
