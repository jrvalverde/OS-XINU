.SH NAME
ex4 - example program 4
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ex4
simulates the Dining Philosophers' problem.
There are 5 philosophers whose mission in life is to
meditate for a random amount of time, wait for a spot at the
table, wait for the left fork, wait for the right fork,
eat for a random amount of time, then relinquish the right and
left forks and leave the table.  Each philosopher must have
both forks before he can start eating, and there is only
one fork between any two philosophers.  In order to
avoid a deadlock situation, a maximum of 4 philosophers are
allowed at the table at any one time.
.PP
The restriction of having only 4 philosophers at the table at a time
and the restriction that a fork can be used by only 1 philosopher
at a time is easily controlled using semaphores -- one for
the table (initially count 4) and one for each of the five forks
(initially count 1).
.PP
The main task creates the semaphores then starts each of the
philosopher tasks, passing an id number to the task.
The tasks then go about there business in parallel.
.PP
The output from this program should be self-explanitory
(although is might go by pretty fast in spots).
.SH BUGS
The output doesn't look too pretty.  But how can you do it
in an intelligible way ??
