.TH EX5 1CCC
.SH NAME
ex5 - example program 5
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ex5
shows the non-blocking nature of ConcurrenC I/O.
Two tasks read from input, while one task reads a line from a file,
prints the line, sleeps 5 seconds, and repeats this until the
other two tasks exit (when they see 'quit' entered).
The input tasks do not block the output/sleeping tasks while they
are waiting for input.
.PP
The program looks for its input in a file ./data/ex5.in.  If it finds
this file, the output will be echoed into file ./data/ex5.out.
If ./data5/in is not found, the program looks for input in ./ex5.in.
If this is found, the output will be echoed into file ./ex5.out.
If neither of these input files are found, a message to this
effect is printed and the program exits.
.PP
The program prints out more information about itself.
