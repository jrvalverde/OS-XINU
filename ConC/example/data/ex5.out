This program has three tasks running:
	2 reading from input and
	1 reading from a file, printing to the terminal,
		then sleeping for 5 seconds.

All output will be echoed to file 'ex5.out' in 'data' directory
	to test writing to a file.

This shows how 2 processes are queued up to read from the same
	input and how this reading does not block other task(s).

To get the full effect, wait a long time (about 30 seconds)
	before typing anything in.  When you want to stop, type
	'quit' twice (once for each input task).

Hit return when you want to continue:
Enter a line.

input process 1 ==>	hi

input process 2 ==>	good

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

input process 1 ==>	wow

input process 2 ==>	ls

input process 1 ==>	ll

input process 2 ==>	ll

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

input process 1 ==>	ll

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

input process 2 ==>	ss

input process 2 ==>	ff

input process 1 ==>	dd

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

Come on.  Enter a line.

Why don't you want to enter a line ??

input process 2 ==>	oops

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

input process 1 ==>	kk

input process 2 ==>	

input process 1 ==>	

input process 2 ==>	j

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

Come on.  Enter a line.

Why don't you want to enter a line ??

PLEASE enter a line.

What's wrong with you, boah!!  Enter that line.

Can't you read (or write)??  Enter a line.

This is getting outrageous! Enter a line, or go home.

This is your last chance to enter a line.  Else I will start over.

Enter a line.

input process 1 ==>	quit

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

input process 2 ==>	ll

input process 2 ==>	

input process 2 ==>	

input process 2 ==>	s

input process 2 ==>	d

input process 2 ==>	d

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.

Enter a line.

input process 2 ==>	hi there

input process 2 ==>	grweat

input process 2 ==>	quit

Finally you enterred something!!  Do it again.
