     _B_e_d is the BBBBackEEEEnd DDDDaemon that runs on the frontend machine.
     It accepts status, odt, and download requests from other
     frontends and then services these requests.  It reads the
     configuration of the backend machines it needs to service
     from a _M_a_c_h_i_n_e_s _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e, and it keeps lock files for each
     reserved backend machine.

     _B_e_d can be run by anyone - it is not a setuid program.  It
     runs in the background, so after typing _b_e_d it returns
     immediately.  _B_e_d actually starts 2 processes running in the
     background, a parent process and one child process.  The
     parent process simply starts the child process and then
     waits for it to die.  The child process is the _r_e_a_l BED pro-
     cess.  It is the one that services requests from other fron-
     tends.  If for some reason the child process dies the parent
     detects it and restarts a new child process as the BED pro-
     cess.  This insures that the BED process will always be run-
     ning.

     _S_t_a_t_u_s requests are replied to immediately, but _o_d_t and
     _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d requests cause a new process to be forked off to
     handle the request. Currently the _o_d_t and _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d built
     into the BED only work when connected to a backend SSSSUUUUNNNN.
     Thus the BED process should only be run on frontends that
     have a SSSSUUUUNNNN as one of the backends.  A -v (verbose) option
     has been added to aid in debugging if problems are encoun-
     tered.

     Currently the _o_d_t and _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d built into the BED only work
     when connected to a backend SSSSUUUUNNNN.  Thus the BED process
     should only be run on frontends that have a SSSSUUUUNNNN as one of
     the backends.
