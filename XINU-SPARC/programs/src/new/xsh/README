NAME
	xsh - a dynamically loaded xinu shell

SYNOPSIS
	xsh [-t terminal_type] [-n login_name] [-p] [arguments]*

DESCRIPTION

	Options.
	The -t option is used to set the the environment variable TERM.
	If the -t option is not given and TERM is not set then TERM
	is set to the default value 'xterms'.

	The -n option is to set the environment variable USER.  If -n
	option is not given and USER is not set then

	is set to 
	Syntax and Grammar.
	Xsh is a line at a time command programming language that reads
	input from the terminal or a file.  Command line editing is
	handled by the gnu readline function (read corresponding man
	pages for more information).  The readline function provides
	command line editing very similar to that of ksh.

	The following meta-characters have special meanings :

	\    "    '    &    <    >    ;    $    new-line    tab    space


	An identifier is a sequence of characters surrounded by single
	quotes, or a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes,
	or a sequence of characters other than the meta-characters.  The
	meta-character backslash is used as an escape character.

	A simple command consist of the command name followed by
	the argument list, input redirection, output redirection,
	and the background symbol.  All parts of the the simple
	command are optional except the command name.

	    simple command  -> cmd arglist redirect_in redirect_out background

	    cmd		    -> IDENTIFIER

	    arglist	    -> [ IDENTIFIER ]*

	    redirect_in	    -> [ < IDENTIFIER ]

	    redirect_out    -> [ > IDENTIFIER ]

            background      -> [ & ]


	A compound command is a series of simple commands separated by
	semicolons.

	    compound command-> simple command [ ; simple command ]*


	Variables.
	Xsh maintains a set of environment variables and local variables.
  	Builtin functions are provides to set and review these variables
	(for more information see the section on builtin commands).

	When xsh creates a child process, xsh exports its environment to
	the child.  This does not include the local variables, only the
	environment variables.

	Current Working Directory.
	Xsh uses the enviroment variable PWD to hold the current working
	directory.  By using an environment variable, the problem of
	setting the child's current working directory is solved.  Recall
	that all of the shell's environment variables, include PWD, are
	exported to the new child process.
