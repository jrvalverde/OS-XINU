This directory contains a small subset of public domain unix C library
routines.  They are designed to for use with the vmxinu operating
system and they call routines found in vmxinu's "unix simulation
library".

We would use Unix's C library, however, it is not public domain.  In
addition, the "unix simulation library" does not simulate all unix
system calls, so some of Unix's C library would be useless anyway.
