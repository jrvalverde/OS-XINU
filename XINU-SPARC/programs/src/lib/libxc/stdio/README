This directory contains very (let me emphasis VERY) simple minded routines
that immitate the standard C library stdio functions.

Unlike the standard C lib stdio functions that do buffering, these routines
do not do any buffering.  This makes some programs (like editors which
may read an entire file using the fgetc() routine) intolerable.

We suggest you copy over your C lib stdio source code (assuming you have source
code) and link with that.  If you don't have source code, then you will have
to settle for this implementation unless you care to rewrite the stdio
routines correctly.
