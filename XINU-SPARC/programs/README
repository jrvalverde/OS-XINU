VM Xinu User Level Programs README - {Xinu-directory}/programs/README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains VM Xinu programs.  Moreover, it can be
used as the root directory for VM Xinu.  That is, mount / on RFILSYS
(or NFS) {THIS-DIR}, where {THIS-DIR} is the directory name this
README file is in.  You can do this from the VM Xinu shell by typing
the command

	mount / NFS "{NFS-server-host}:{file-system}:{THIS-DIR}"
or
	mount / RFILSYS {THIS-DIR}	/* if you use RFS */

if it is not already mounted.
(Note: You can modify file src/sys/net/rfs/naminit.c to mount it for you.)

To make the programs in this directory:

1. Make the 3 libraries and install them by:
	cd {THIS-DIR}/src/lib/unixsyscall
	make install
	cd {THIS-DIR}/src/lib/libxc
	make install
	cd {THIS-DIR}/src/lib/readline/src
	make install

2. Make each program and install it by:

	cd {THIS-DIR}/src/new/{PROGNAME}
		where {PROGNAME} is the program name
	make install

	Do this for each program

3. To write your own program:
	Write your program just as you would a unix program. You may
	use many of the normal unix system calls.  You may also call
	the normal xinu system calls (all xinu system calls begin with
	an x (i.e. xsuspend, xresume, xsend, xreceive, etc) to avoid
	confusion with unix system call names).  Then link them with
	the 2 libraries mentioned above. 


NOTE: 	The unixsyscall library is a unix simulation library that emulates
	some of the unix kernel calls.  The libxc library is a small
	public domain subset of the normal C library.  This is usually
	enough to write simple programs like the ones found in this
	directory.

	If you have Sun source code for the normal C library, we
	encourage you to take parts (in particular the stdio routines
	and the general routines (gen)) and compile them into a little
	more substantial C library.  However, do not attempt to use
	the entire "normal" C library because it makes unix kernel
	calls that are not supported by our unix simulation library
	unixsyscall.a (it also may expect a floating point unit).
