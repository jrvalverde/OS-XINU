NAME
     netnum - compute the network portion of a given Internet
     (IP) address

SYNOPSIS
     #include <network.h>

     int netnum(netpart, address)
     IPaddr netpart;
     IPaddr address;

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_n_u_m extracts the network portion of the Internet address
     specified by argument _a_d_d_r_e_s_s, and places the result in
     argument _n_e_t_p_a_r_t.  It operates by using the IP class of
     argument _a_d_d_r_e_s_s to determine whether the network part of
     the address occupies 1, 2, or 3 bytes, and it zeros the
     remaining bytes.  _N_e_t_n_u_m always returns OK.

SEE ALSO
     getaddr(2), getnet(2)

BUGS
     _N_e_t_n_u_m does not understand subnets or subnet masks.
