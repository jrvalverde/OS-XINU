NAME
     ip2name - translate an Internet address to a host Domain
     Name

SYNOPSIS
     int *ip2name(ip, name)
     IPaddr ip;

     char *name;

DESCRIPTION
     _I_p_2_n_a_m_e accepts a 4-byte Internet (IP) address and returns
     the Domain Name for that host by consulting a DARPA Domain
     nameserver to perform the translation.  Argument _i_p gives
     the address of a 4-byte host Internet address to be
     translated into a name.  Argument _n_a_m_e points to an area of
     memory in which the domain name will be written.  The name
     is written as a null-terminated byte string with periods
     separating domain name components.

     _I_p_2_n_a_m_e returns _S_Y_S_E_R_R if the Internet address is invalid,
     if the nameserver does not respond, or if the translation
     fails.  It returns _O_K otherwise.

SEE ALSO
     getname(2), getaddr(2)

BUGS
     There is no way to specify a long time delay, so name lookup
     that consults a distant nameserver may timeout due to net-
     work delays.  Also, there is no way to specify a maximum
     name size.
