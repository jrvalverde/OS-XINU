READ(2)             Xinu Programmer's Manual              READ(2)



NAME
     read - device independent input routine

SYNOPSIS
     int read(dev, buffer, numchars)
     int dev;
     char *buffer;
     int numchars;

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_a_d will read up to _n_u_m_c_h_a_r_s bytes from the I/O device
     given by _d_e_v. It returns SYSERR if _d_e_v is incorrect.  It
     returns the number of characters read if successful.  The
     number of bytes actually returned depends on the device.
     For example, when reading from a device of type "tty", each
     read normally returns one line.  For a disk, however, each
     read returns one block and the argument _n_u_m_c_h_a_r_s is taken to
     be the index of the disk block desired.
