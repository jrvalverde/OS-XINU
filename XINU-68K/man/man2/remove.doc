REMOVE(2)           Xinu Programmer's Manual            REMOVE(2)



NAME
     remove - remove a file from the file system

SYNOPSIS
     int remove(filename, key)
     char *filename;
     int key;

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_m_o_v_e takes a file name as an argument and destroys the
     named file (i.e., removes it from the file system).  Argu-
     ment _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e specifies the name of a file to remove, and
     the optional argument _k_e_y gives a one-word protection key.

     _R_e_m_o_v_e uses the namespace to map the given file name to a
     new name, and invokes CONTROL(2) on the underlying device to
     destroy the file.  It returns SYSERR if the name is illegal
     or cannot be mapped to an underlying device.  It returns
     whatever CONTROL(2) returns otherwise.
