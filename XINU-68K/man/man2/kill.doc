KILL(2)             Xinu Programmer's Manual              KILL(2)



NAME
     kill - terminate a process

SYNOPSIS
     int kill(pid)
     int pid;

DESCRIPTION
     _K_i_l_l will stop process _p_i_d and remove it from the system,
     returning SYSERR if the process id is invalid, OK otherwise.
     _K_i_l_l terminates a process immediately.  If the process has
     been queued on a semaphore, it is removed from the queue and
     the semaphore count is incremented as if the process had
     never been there.  Processes waiting to send a message to a
     full port disappear without affecting the port.  If the pro-
     cess is waiting for I/O, the I/O is stopped (if possible).

     One can kill a process in any state, including a suspended
     one.  Once killed, a process cannot recover.

BUGS
     At present there is no way to recover space allocated dynam-
     ically when a process terminates.  However, _k_i_l_l does
     recover the stack space allocated to a process when it is
     created.
