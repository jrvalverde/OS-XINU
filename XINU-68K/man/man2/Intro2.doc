The Xinu operating system kernel consists of a  set  of  run-time
procedures  to  implement  operating  system  services on a Sun 3
workstation.   The  system  supports  multiple  processes,   I/O,
synchronization   based   on   counting   semaphores,  preemptive
scheduling, and communication with other machines.  Each page  in
this  section  describes a system routine that can be called by a
user process.  Each page describes one system  call,  giving  the
number  and  types  of  arguments  that  must  be  passed  to the
procedure  under  the  heading  "SYNOPSIS"   (by   giving   their
declaration  in  C  syntax).  The heading "SEE ALSO" suggests the
names of other system calls that may be related to the  described
function.  For example, the "SEE ALSO" entry for system call _w_a_i_t
suggests that the programmer may want to look  at  the  page  for
_s_i_g_n_a_l  because both routines operate on semaphores.  In general,
Xinu blocks processes when requested services are not  available.
Unless  the manual page suggests otherwise, the programmer should
assume that the process requesting system services may be delayed
until  the  request  can be satisfied.  For example, calling _r_e_a_d
may cause an arbitrary delay until data can be obtained from  the
device.
