PDELETE(2)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           PDELETE(2)



NAME
     pdelete - delete a port

SYNOPSIS
     int pdelete(portid, dispose)
     int portid;
     int (*dispose)();

DESCRIPTION
     _P_d_e_l_e_t_e deallocates port _p_o_r_t_i_d. The call returns SYSERR if
     _p_o_r_t_i_d is illegal or is not currently allocated.

     The command has several effects, depending on the state of
     the port at the time the call is issued.  If processes are
     waiting for messages from portid, they are made ready and
     return SYSERR to their caller. If messages exist in the
     port, they are disposed of by procedure _d_i_s_p_o_s_e.  If
     processes are waiting to place messages in the port, they
     are made ready and given SYSERR indications (just as if the
     port never existed).  _P_d_e_l_e_t_e performs the same function of
     clearing messages and processes from a port as PRESET(2)
     except that _p_d_e_l_e_t_e also deallocates the port.
