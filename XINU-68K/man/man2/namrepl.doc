NAME
     namrepl - replace a name once using the syntactic namespace

SYNOPSIS
     int namrepl(name, newname)
     char *name;
     char *newname;

DESCRIPTION
     _N_a_m_r_e_p_l uses the syntactic namespace to translate a name
     into a new name and returns the id of a device to which the
     name maps.  The name is translated exactly once, independent
     of the device to which it maps.  In particular, _n_a_m_r_e_p_l will
     return the device id _N_A_M_E_S_P_A_C_E without further mapping for
     those names that map recursively through the syntactic
     namespace.

     Argument _n_a_m_e points to a null-terminated string containing
     the name to be mapped, and argument _n_e_w_n_a_m_e points to a
     string area large enough to hold the mapped version of the
     name.  If successful, _n_a_m_r_e_p_l returns the device id of the
     device to which the name maps.  Otherwise, it returns
     SYSERR.

SEE ALSO
     nammap(2), open(2), mount(2), unmount(2), namespace(4)

BUGS
     _N_a_m_r_e_p_l writes the mapped name into _n_e_w_n_a_m_e without checking
     to make sure it fits.  There is no way to distinguish errors
     such as string overflow from names that map to device
     SYSERR.
