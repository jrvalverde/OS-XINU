NAME
     pcreate - create a new port

SYNOPSIS
     int pcreate(count)
     int count;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_c_r_e_a_t_e creates a port with _c_o_u_n_t locations for storing mes-
     sage pointers.

     _P_c_r_e_a_t_e returns an integer identifying  the port if success-
     ful.  If no more ports can be allocated, or if _c_o_u_n_t is non-
     positive, _p_c_r_e_a_t_e returns SYSERR.

     Ports are manipulated with PSEND(2) and PRECEIVE(2).
     Receiving from a port returns a pointer to a message that
     was previously sent to the port.
