     _O_d_t connects a terminal on the VAX to a microcomputer tty
     line so the output of the micro appears on the terminal
     screen and characters typed at the keyboard are sent to the
     micro.  _O_d_t sets the micro tty line to raw mode, and the VAX
     terminal to cbreak mode.  The connection can be broken by
     killing the odt process (e.g., by typing the interrupt char-
     acter (e.g., CONTROL-C).

     When _o_d_t receives a backslash from the terminal, it switches
     to raw mode to read one character, after which it switches
     back to cbreak mode.  The backslash escape allows the user
     to send characters like CONTROL-C to the micro even though
     they are normally interpreted as signals.  As a special
     case, an escaped null character (octal 0) causes _o_d_t to
     force the micro line into a break condition for 1 second.
     This is useful for trapping a Sun into monitor mode.
