     _P_m performs a post mortem given a core image from a Sun run-
     ning Xinu.  It takes as input the memory image (in Sun a.out
     format) that was _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_ded, uploads the core image (in Sun
     core format) from the Sun, and prints the following informa-
     tion:

          Differences between the text portions (program instruc-
          tion areas) of the file before downloading and after
          uploading.  Except for interrupt vectors which are ini-
          tialized at run-time, differences indicate that
          instructions were accidentally overwritten.

          C traceback of the executing process, based on Xinu's
          _c_u_r_r_p_i_d.

          C traceback of all other processes.

          The status of all semaphores.  If a semaphore is in use
          and the count indicates that there are processes wait-
          ing, the list of waiting processes is printed along
          with an actual count.  Backward links are checked for
          consistency.

          The status of tty devices, including the buffer head
          and tail pointers along with buffer contents.

     By default, _p_m takes the downloaded image from file _p_m._o_u_t,
     and produces all of the above output.  _P_m always prints
     information about the current process.  If the following
     flags are present, _p_m prints only the information requested.

     ----pppp   dump the process table.

     ----ssss   dump the semaphore table.

     ----tttt   dump the tty tables.

     ----mmmm   check for overwritten text

     ----rrrr   print a stack trace of all processes

     ----vvvv   give verbose messages

     Optional arguments _t_x_t_f_i_l and _c_o_r_f_i_l can be specified to
     change the files used as the downloaded and uploaded image.

     _P_m may fault when given garbage files (e.g., a badly damaged
     core file) because it references symbols in the core image
     based on values obtained from the a.out file without check-
     ing their validity.
