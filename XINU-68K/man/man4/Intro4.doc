This section of the manual  describes  the  Xinu  device  drivers
available  on  the  distribution tape.  Each device driver imple-
ments the device independent  I/O  routines  _o_p_e_n,  _c_l_o_s_e,  _r_e_a_d,
_w_r_i_t_e,  _s_e_e_k,  _g_e_t_c, _p_u_t_c, _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, and _i_n_i_t, for one physical or
pseudo-device.  While the intuitive meanings  of  these  routines
are  the  same  across all devices, each driver defines specific,
sometimes device dependent meaning  to  them.   If  a  particular
operation  does not make sense for a given device, the driver may
choose to return _S_Y_S_E_R_R or _O_K without taking further action.
