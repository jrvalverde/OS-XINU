Sun3.V7 -- install.README

Installation Details
------------ -------

This is file {Xinu-directory}/install/README.  It contains
instructions for installing the Xinu software and recompiling
it.  These instructions instructions must be followed:
(a) after the distribution tape has been read in, or
(b) after the Xinu directory has been moved.


Installation involves changing references to {Xinu-directory}
in all source files and then recompiling them.

Step 1:	Execute shell script "Install" in this directory
	to climb around the tree and create final versions
	of the source files.

		cd {Xinu-directory}/install
		./Install

Step 2:	Change to the source directory and execute the script
	that rebuilds binaries:

		cd {Xinu-directory}/src
        	Makeall > make.out &

	If you have installed Xinu in other than /usr/Xinu,
	this program takes more than 30 minutes on a SUN 3-50
	(Hence, we suggest that you run it in background).
	Also be warned that there are numerous programs in
	the cross-development software that produce warning
	messages when recompiled.  You do not need to be
	superuser; only directories under {Xinu-directory}
	are affected. 

Step 3:	Add {Xinu-directory}/bin to your "path" so you can
	execute	commands that are found there:

	C-shell users type:

		set path=( $path {Xinu-directory}/bin )

	Bourne shell users type:

		PATH=$PATH:{Xinu-directory}/bin
		export PATH

	To make Xinu commands accessible after your next
	login, you must change the path assignment in your
	.profile or .cshrc files.


Step 4:	Try the command "odt" in {Xinu-directory}/bin. It
	connects your keyboard to serial line A so that
	keystrokes go to the back end sun, and it's output
	comes to your screen:

		odt

	To get the attention of the LSI, type backslash
	followed by null (CONTROL @).  The Sun will stop
	execution and print a prompt (">").  You
	are now talking to the Sun's monitor program.
	(consult the vendor's manual for additional
	information on the monitor commands).
	To terminate the odt command, kill the
	process with your normal interrupt character
	(usually CONTROL-C or DELETE).

Step 5: Change to the installation directory and download
	the test program:

		cd {Xinu-directory}/install
		cp a.out /tftpboot
		odt
		b -a    /* monitor command */

	It will print "hello world." and stop.  When all
	processes complete, type CONTROL-c to kill the odt
	command.


Step 7:	You are ready to experiment with Xinu itself.
	Change to the source directory and modify the
	configuration for your Sun.

		cd {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys
		...edit file "Configuration"...
		make a.out
		make download
		odt
		b -a     /* monitor command */

	Note that because recompiling the Xinu sources
	may take considerable time.  It is advisable to
	run make in the background with output (and error
	messages) directed to a file.

	Make will recompile the Xinu sources, rebuild
	file "xinu.o", and rebind library "libx.a".
	However, it leaves the new versions in source
	directory.  Make also compiles file "test.c"
	and binds it with the new library to form file
	"a.out".  When you are satisfied that the new
	version works, run "make install" to copy the new
	version into {Xinu-directory}/lib where command
	cc accesses it.

	Other arguments can be used with make.  For details
	see the file "Makefile".  Two that particularly
	useful ones are "everything" that runs several
	scripts designed to test source program formats,
	and "download" that copies the a.out file into the
	directory where the back end Sun expects to find it.
