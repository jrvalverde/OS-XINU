     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d takes an absolute binary program image (SUN a.out
     format) and copies it to the frontend file /_t_f_t_p_b_o_o_t/_a._o_u_t
     for the backend sun to use when booting.  _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d deter-
     mines which backend SUN the user has reserved, or finds a
     free backend SUN if the user does not have a backend SUN
     reserved.  Once a backend is found, _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d uses TCP to
     send the binary program image to the associated front end.
     Note that local net broadcasts are used to find free backend
     SUNs so downloading is only allowed to SUNs connected to the
     local net.  There is one exception to this rule.  You may
     download from a frontend on a remote net to a frontend run-
     ning a BED server on the local net if the frontend on the
     remote net has a bedservers file which lists all of the
     frontends running BED servers.

     Loading the object program takes time proportional to the
     size of the program itself.  In two seconds, download will
     transfer about 56K bytes over the ethernet using TCP.

     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d transfers the user's program as specified in the
     command line.  If no program name is given, _a._o_u_t is used.

     Options are:

     ----cccc_C_L_A_S_S
          Class.  Use a machine in the class _C_L_A_S_S. The default
          class is SUN.  If the user already has a backend
          reserved in class _C_L_A_S_S, then it will be used. If no
          machines are available in class _C_L_A_S_S a message indi-
          cating this will be printed.  See also _b_u_s_e_r_s, which
          displays which class each backend machine belongs to.

     ----mmmm_M_A_C_H
          Machine.  Use the backend machine named _M_A_C_H if it is
          available.  A user may now reserve two or more machines
          at once.  The first machine they reserve will not
          automatically be released like the original version of
          the software used to do.  Moreover,  the tty line and
          the user name are used to make a reservation.  This
          means that a user can download to two different backend
          machines from two different windows on his workstation,
          and the reservation system will remember which window
          is associated with each backend.  If you want to down-
          load to two different backends from the same window,
          then you must specify the desired backend each time, or

          the reservation system will automatically download to
          the backend that you used most recently in that window.

     ----vvvv   Verbose.  The verbose option will print messages indi-
          cating what the program is currently doing.

     Currently it only works to download to a backend SUN.  You
     can download from a frontend SUN or VAX.  In future versions
     you will be able to download from anything to anything.
