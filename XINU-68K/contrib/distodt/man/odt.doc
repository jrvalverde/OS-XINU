     _O_d_t connects a terminal on the SUN (or VAX) to a backend
     SUN's console line so the output of the backend SUN appears
     on the terminal screen and characters typed at the keyboard
     are sent to the backend SUN.  _O_d_t sets the backend SUN's tty
     line to raw mode, and the SUN (or VAX) terminal to cbreak
     mode.  The connection can be broken by killing the odt pro-
     cess (e.g., by typing the interrupt character (e.g.,
     CONTROL-C).

     When _o_d_t receives a backslash from the terminal, it switches
     to raw mode to read one character, after which it switches
     back to cbreak mode.  The backslash escape allows the user
     to send characters like CONTROL-C to the backend SUN even
     though they are normally interpreted as signals.  As a spe-
     cial case, an escaped null character (octal 0) causes _o_d_t to
     force the backend SUN line into a break condition for 1
     second.  This is useful for halting the processor and trap-
     ping to the SUN monitor program.

     Options are:

     ----cccc_C_L_A_S_S
          Class. Connect to a machine in the class _C_L_A_S_S if one
          is available.  The default class is SUN.  If the user
          already has a machine reserved in the class _C_L_A_S_S, then
          the reserved machine will be used. If no machines are
          available in the specified class then a message to that
          effect will be printed.

     ----mmmm_M_A_C_H
          Machine.  Use the backend SUN named _M_A_C_H if it is
          available.  A user may now reserve two or more machines
          at once.  The first machine they reserve will not
          automatically be released like the original version of
          the software used to do.  Moreover,  the tty line and
          the user name are used to make a reservation.  This
          means that a user can odt to two different backend
          machines from two different windows on his workstation,
          and the reservation system will remember which window
          is associated with each backend.  If you want to odt to
          two different backends from the same window, then you
          must specify the desired backend each time, or the
          reservation system will automatically odt to the back-
          end that you used most recently in that window.  If
          machine _M_A_C_H is unavailable, then a message to that

     Avoid suspending odt (CONTROL-Z) if possible since it will
