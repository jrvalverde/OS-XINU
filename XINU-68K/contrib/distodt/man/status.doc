     _S_t_a_t_u_s is really a combination of _f_u_s_e_r_s and _b_u_s_e_r_s. It
     prints the status of each frontend and its associated back-
     ends.  For each frontend running a BED server it prints the
     number of users, the load average, and the number of back-
     ends.  For each backend connected to the frontend it prints
     the backend machine's name, the class it belongs to, the tty
     line it is connected to, the user who has it reserved, and
     the idle time.

     _S_t_a_t_u_s lists reservations and idle time based on lock file
     times which may not be quite accurate.  Machines with more
     than 10 minutes of idle time are listed even though the
     reservation software considers the reservation to have
     expired.
