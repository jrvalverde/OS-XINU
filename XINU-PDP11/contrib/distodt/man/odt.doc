     _O_d_t connects a terminal on the SUN (or VAX) to a backend
     SUN's console line so the output of the backend SUN appears
     on the terminal screen and characters typed at the keyboard
     are sent to the backend SUN.  _O_d_t sets the backend SUN's tty
     line to raw mode, and the SUN (or VAX) terminal to cbreak
     mode.  The connection can be broken by killing the odt pro-
     cess (e.g., by typing the interrupt character (e.g.,
     CONTROL-C).

     When _o_d_t receives a backslash from the terminal, it switches
     to raw mode to read one character, after which it switches
     back to cbreak mode.  The backslash escape allows the user
     to send characters like CONTROL-C to the backend SUN even
     though they are normally interpreted as signals.  As a spe-
     cial case, an escaped null character (octal 0) causes _o_d_t to
     force the backend SUN line into a break condition for 1
     second.  This is useful for halting the processor and trap-
     ping to the SUN monitor program.

     Options are:

     ----cccc_C_L_A_S_S
          Class. Connect to a machine in the class _C_L_A_S_S if one
          is available.  The default class is SUN.  If the user
          already has a machine reserved in the class _C_L_A_S_S, then
          the reserved machine will be used.  However, if the
          user already has a machine reserved in a different
          class, then it will be released before the new machine
          is reserved. If no machines are available in the speci-
          fied class then a message to that effect will be
          printed.

     ----mmmm_M_A_C_H
          Machine.  Use the backend SUN named _M_A_C_H if it is
          available.  If the user already has a backend SUN
          reserved, then it will be released before the new
          machine _M_A_C_H is reserved.  If machine _M_A_C_H is unavail-
          able, then a message to that effect will be printed.

     Avoid suspending odt (CONTROL-Z) if possible since it will
     leave the terminal line in cbreak mode.
