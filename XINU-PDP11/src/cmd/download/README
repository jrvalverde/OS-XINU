			    README

This directory contains source and a Makefile for the umbrella downloader
and uploader commands.  The umbrella commands, like "download" and "upload"
examine the machine database to determine which of several possible micros
the user will be assigned, allocates the micro, and then invokes a machine-
specific downloader/uploader command, depending on what is specified in the
machine database.  An example database is contained in file machines.example;
the copy actually used resides in {Xinu-directory}/lib/machines.

The subdirectories are structured as follows:

	cmd	contains the source for umbrella commands.  These are
		the commands that users invoke from the shell level to
		download or upload a microcomputer.
	h	contains include files used by the umbrella commands and
		elsewhere.  There are links to files in this directory
		from several lower level h directories.
	lib	contains the source for all the database search
		routines and device reservation routines.  Files in
		this directory are compiled to produce libd.a, which is
		referenced in Makefiles for both umbrella commands and
		device-specific routines.
	lsi11	contains the source for serial-line and Ethernet-based
		Vax-to-LSI 11 downloaders.  Both the LSI-resident code
		as well as code that runs under UNIX on the host (vax)
		is included.
	vax	contains the source for serial and Ethernet VAX-to-VAX
		downloaders (usually used for VAX-to-microvax, but can
		be used to download almost any Vax through the console
		port, including machines like 8600s.

The makefile here calls make on the cmd, Lsi11, and Vax subdirectories.
If you add downloading code for other target micros, add a new subdirectory
under this one with all the downloading source code related to that machine
(including source for boot loaders that executes on the micro as well as
source for the downloader itself).
