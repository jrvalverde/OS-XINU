NAME
     cvt - Convert disable/restore assembler macros to standard
     assembler

SYNOPSIS
     cvt _i_n_f_i_l_e

DESCRIPTION
     _C_v_t is a special-purpose filter used to convert nonstandard
     assembler language code to standard form.  The nonstandard
     code arises from the _d_i_s_a_b_l_e and _r_e_s_t_o_r_e macro definitions,
     which insert literal text into the assembler language output
     of _c_c_1_1 without resolving symbolic references.  When
     invoked, _c_v_t reads the assembler language contained in
     _i_n_f_i_l_e, remembering the offset of the local variable _p_s.  It
     replaces symbolic references to _p_s with the correct offset.

     _C_v_t detects possible misuse of _d_i_s_a_b_l_e and _r_e_s_t_o_r_e by
     returning a nonzero exit code if it finds references to
     local variable _p_s without finding a definition.

BUGS
     When multiple procedures have been compiled into one assem-
     bler file, _c_v_t may fail to detect missing declarations of _p_s
     in later procedures because it treats the entire input file
     as a single text file.
