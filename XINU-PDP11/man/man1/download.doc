NAME
     download - load program into LSI-11

SYNOPSIS
     download [ file ] ...  [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d loads an absolute binary program image (PDP-11
     a.out format) into the memory of an LSI-11 computer over an
     ethernet or an asynchronous line.  After halting the LSI-11
     with a break, _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d either places a bootstrap in memory,
     and uses it to load the remainder of memory, or jumps to the
     resident portion of the downloader.

     Loading the object program takes time proportional to the
     size of the program itself.  In two seconds, download will
     load about 56K bytes over the ethernet, or 1000 bytes over a
     serial line.

     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d will normally leave the LSI 11 in ODT.  The -_a
     option requests _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d to auto-start the micro.  The
     optional number _N following -_a, forces a delay of approxi-
     mately _N seconds before execution, allowing the user to
     reconnect the console port before output begins.

     The serial-loader bootstrap program is loaded 100 words
     beyond the end of the user's object program.  If there is
     insufficient memory for the bootstrap and stack, this pro-
     gram will fail.  The ethernet downloader stores it's LSI-
     resident portion in real page 7, beyond normal object pro-
     grams (virtual page 7 is used for memory-mapped I/O).

     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d loads the user's program as specified in the com-
     mand line.  If no program name is given, _a._o_u_t is used.

     Options are:

     -v   Verbose.  Print details of the communications with the
          LSI-11/2.

     -s   Silent.  Print no information messages (default is to
          print some messages).

     -a[_N]
          Autostart.  After loading, start the user's program
          running in the LSI-11.  Optionally delay _N seconds.

     -lx  Use LSI number _x as the LSI 11 for downloading.  If
          this option is not specified, download selects the
          LSI-11 that the user has on reserve, or a free one if
          none is reserved.  E.g., -l9.

     -d _f Use file _f as the downloader program (download will
          exec it, after parsing arguments).

     -cL  Use LSI in class L (as specified in the _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s data-
          base).

     -BX  Use Baudrate _X in communicating with the LSI console.

     -h   Hold the LSI, so multiple machines may be allocated to
          one user.

     -e   Reload the resident portion of the ethernet downloader
          (into a page beyond real page 7).
