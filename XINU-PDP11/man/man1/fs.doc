NAME
     fs - invoke server side of Xinu remote file system

SYNOPSIS
     fs [ -pport  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _F_s invokes the Xinu remote file system server on a UNIX
     host.  The server executes with permissions set to that of
     the invoking user, or user ``xinu'' if it is able to change
     user id.  Typically, the host machine invokes _f_s at system
     startup, making it available always.

     Option -p allows the user to specify a _U_D_P port number to
     which the server will respond.  If -p is omitted, _f_s uses a
     default port number.  Thus, it is possible to have several
     versions of the server in use simultaneously, with each ver-
     sion using a unique UDP port.

     When started, _f_s forks a child in background to become the
     file server.  The background process executes forever, but
     the foreground process exits.  Thus, the _f_s command appears
     to complete instantly even though the server is still exe-
     cuting.
