NAME
     ranlib11 - convert LSI 11 cross-archives to random cross-
     libraries

SYNOPSIS
     ranlib11 archive ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_a_n_l_i_b_1_1 converts each _a_r_c_h_i_v_e to a form which can be loaded
     more rapidly by the LSI 11 cross-loader, by adding a table
     of contents named __.SYMDEF to the beginning of the archive.
     It uses _a_r(1) to reconstruct the archive, so that sufficient
     temporary file space must be available in the file system
     containing the current directory.

SEE ALSO
     ld11(1), ar(1)

BUGS
     Because generation of a library by _a_r and randomization by
     _r_a_n_l_i_b_1_1 are separate, phase errors are possible.  The
     cross-loader _l_d_1_1 warns when the modification date of a
     library is more recent than the creation of its dictionary;
     but this means you get the warning even if you only copy the
     library.
