NAME
     odtunlock - release lock on a tty line

SYNOPSIS
     odtunlock [ -cclass ] [ -lx ]

DESCRIPTION
     _O_d_t_u_n_l_o_c_k releases the caller's currently reserved microcom-
     puter, making it available for others to use.  Mutual exclu-
     sion locks are created automatically by _o_d_t and _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d,
     and are reported by _l_u_s_e_r_s.  Reservations may expire after
     some idle time even if _o_d_t_u_n_l_o_c_k is not used (see default
     timeout values set in Xinu-directory/lib/machines).

     Without arguments, _o_d_t_u_n_l_o_c_k removes the reservation on the
     tty line most recently accessed by the caller.  Argument -c
     can be used to specify a _c_l_a_s_s, in which case _o_d_t_u_n_l_o_c_k
     removes the user's most recently held reservation in that
     class.  Argument -lx forces _o_d_t_u_n_l_o_c_k to cancel the reserva-
     tion on line number _x within the selected class.

     Xinu's tty reservation system is a friendly, cooperative
     mutual-exclusion mechanism.  All software that accesses tty
     lines for communicating with back-end microcomputers is
     expected to adhere to the reservation system to prevent mul-
     tiple users from trying to access the same machine simul-
     taneously.
