NAME
     subEIS - substitute code for LSI 11 extended instructions

SYNOPSIS
     subASH
     subASHC
     subMUL
     subDIV

DESCRIPTION
     These programs read an LSI 11 assembly language program from
     the standard input, replace opcodes from the  Extended
     Instruction Set (EIS) with a call to a library subroutine
     that simulates them, and write the new listing on the stan-
     dard output.  They are used mainly as filters for compiling
     LSI 11/02 programs for machines without the EIS chip.

     Each program checks for a different instruction; _s_u_b_M_U_L
     checks for (and replaces) _m_u_l instructions, _s_u_b_D_I_V checks
     for (and replaces) _d_i_v instructions, _s_u_b_A_S_H checks for (and
     replaces) _a_s_h instructions, and _s_u_b_A_S_H_C checks for (and
     replaces) _a_s_h_c instructions.  The resulting assembly
     language program must be loaded with the library _l_i_b_e_i_s._a ,
     which contains the routines called.

SEE ALSO
     cc11(1), EIS(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
     The condition codes are correctly set by the above calling
     sequence.

BUGS
     Setting the condition codes accounts for most of the work
     these routines perform.  Unfortunately, they are so slow
     that most programs, including Xinu are unusable on an 11/2
     without the EIS hardware.
