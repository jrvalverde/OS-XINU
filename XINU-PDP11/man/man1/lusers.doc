NAME
     lusers - list users holding odt lock reservations

SYNOPSIS
     lusers

DESCRIPTION
     _L_u_s_e_r_s lists the users who hold reservations on tty lines.
     Each line of output contains the machine name and number,
     the user who holds it, and the idle time, rounded to the
     nearest minute.  Reservations are made by _o_d_t(1), _d_o_w_n_-
     _l_o_a_d(1), and _u_p_l_o_a_d(1).

FILES
     /tmp/LSI-*  Lock files.

SEE ALSO
     odtunlock(1), odt(1)

BUGS
     _L_u_s_e_r_s lists reservations and idle time based on lock file
     times which may not be quite accurate.  Machines with more
     than 10 minutes of idle time are listed even though the
     reservation software considers the reservation to have
     expired.
