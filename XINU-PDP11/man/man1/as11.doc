AS11(1)             Xinu Programmer's Manual              AS11(1)



NAME
     as11 - PDP-11 cross-assembler

SYNOPSIS
     as11 [ -u ] [ -o outfile ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _A_s_1_1 assembles the specified files, using standard input if
     no file name is specified.  If the optional -u argument is
     specified, the assembler makes all undefined symbols in the
     current assembly ``undefined external''; otherwise the
     assembler complains about undefined symbols (.globl can be
     used to declare undefined externals when not using -_u).

     If the -o option is given, _a_s_1_1 writes its output to _o_u_t_-
     _f_i_l_e.  If the -o option is not included, _a_s_1_1 writes output
     to file _a._o_u_t in the current directory.  Following conven-
     tion, the mode of the output file is made executable if
     there were no unresolved external references (even though
     the output file is not directly executable on the cross
     development machine).

FILES
     /tmp/as*       temporary files
     a.out          default object file

DIAGNOSTICS
     _A_s_1_1 is built to accept assembler language output from com-
     pilers, not for humans.  Diagnostics, which consist of
     single-letter messages, are cryptic at best.  See Ritchie,
     ``UNIX Assembler Reference Manual'' for details.
