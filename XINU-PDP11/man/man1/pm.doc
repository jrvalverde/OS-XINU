NAME
     pm - Xinu post mortem debugger

SYNOPSIS
     pm [ -p ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ _t_x_t_f_i_l [ _c_o_r_f_i_l ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_m performs a post mortem given a core image from an LSI 11
     running Xinu.  It takes as input the memory image (in LSI 11
     a.out format) that was _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_ded, and the core image (in
     LSI 11 core format) that was _u_p_l_o_a_ded, and prints the fol-
     lowing information:

          Differences between the text portions (program instruc-
          tion areas) of the file before downloading and after
          uploading.  Except for interrupt vectors which are ini-
          tialized at run-time, differences indicate that
          instructions were accidentally overwritten.  Interrupt
          vectors lie below location 1000 (octal).

          C traceback of the executing process, based on Xinu's
          _c_u_r_r_p_i_d.

          C traceback of all other processes.

          The status of all semaphores.  If a semaphore is in use
          and the count indicates that there are processes wait-
          ing, the list of waiting processes is printed along
          with an actual count.  Backward links are checked for
          consistency.

          The status of tty devices, including the buffer head
          and tail pointers along with buffer contents.

     By default, _p_m takes the downloaded image from file _a._o_u_t,
     the uploaded image from file _c_o_r_e_1_1, and produces all of the
     above output.  _P_m always prints information about the
     current process.  If the following flags are present, _p_m
     prints only the information requested.

     -p   dump the process table.

     -s   dump the semaphore table.

     -t   dump the tty tables.

     Optional arguments _t_x_t_f_i_l and _c_o_r_f_i_l can be specified to
     change the files used as the downloaded and uploaded image.

BUGS
     _P_m may fault when given garbage files (e.g., a badly damaged
     core file) because it references symbols in the core image
     based on values obtained from the a.out file without check-
     ing their validity.
