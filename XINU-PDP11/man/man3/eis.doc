NAME
     EIS - extended instruction set for the LSI-11/2

SYNOPSIS
     jsr pc,times2
     jsr pc,over2
     jsr pc,shift2
     jsr pc,cshft2

DESCRIPTION
     Library _e_i_s._a contains assembly language routines to simu-
     late LSI-11 multiply, divide, arithmetic shift, and arith-
     metic shift combined instructions.  Normally, an assembly
     language listing should be filtered through the programs
     _s_u_b_M_U_L, _s_u_b_D_I_V, _s_u_b_A_S_H, and _s_u_b_A_S_H_C to replace any of the
     extended instructions with the proper calling sequence.  The
     resulting assembly language program must be loaded with this
     library, which contains the routines called.

     These routines do _n_o_t use the C calling conventions. The
     multiply routine is called by:
       mfps  -(sp)     / push psw
       mov   A,-(sp)   / push multiplier
       mov   R,-(sp)   / push multiplicand
       jsr   pc,times2 / call mul simulation routine
       mov   (sp)+,R   / save low word of product
       mov   (sp)+,R+1 / save high word of product
       mtps  (sp)+     / put in new psw
     where the instruction being mimicked is "mul A,R" and R is
     an even-numbered register (if R is odd, change the "mov
     (sp)+,R" to "tst (sp)+" and the "mov (sp)+,R+1" to "mov
     (sp)+,R").

     The division routine is called by:
       mfps  -(sp)     / push psw
       mov   A,-(sp)   / push divisor
       mov   R,-(sp)   / push high word of dividend
       mov   R+1,-(sp) / push low word of dividend
       jsr   pc,over2  / call div simulation routine
       mov   (sp)+,R+1 / save remainder
       mov   (sp)+,R   / save quotient
       tst   (sp)+     / reset stack pointer
       mtps  (sp)+     / put in new psw
     where the instruction being mimicked is "div A,R".

     The arithmetic shift routine is called by:
       mfps  -(sp)     / get psw
       mov   A,-(sp)   / push shift count onto the stack
       mov   r0,-(sp)  / push number to be shifted onto the stack
       jsr   pc,shift2 / call the simulation routine
       mov   (sp)+,r0  / save the result
       tst   (sp)+     / reset stack pointer

       mtps  (sp)+     / put in new psw
     where the instruction being mimicked is "ash A,R".  The
     arithmetic shift combined routine is called by:
       mfps  -(sp)     / get psw
       mov   A,-(sp)   / push shift count onto the stack
       mov   r0,-(sp)  / push high word onto the stack
       mov   r1,-(sp)  / push low word onto the stack
       jsr   pc,shift2 / call the simulation routine
       mov   (sp)+,r1  / save the low word
       mov   (sp)+,r0  / save the high word
       tst   (sp)+     / reset stack pointer
       mtps  (sp)+     / put in the new psw
     where the instruction being mimicked is "ashc A,R".
