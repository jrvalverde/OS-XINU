NAME
     rfilsys - remote file system pseudo-device driver (types
     rfm, rf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <rfile.h>
     #include <fserver.h>

     read(device buffer, length)
     write(device, buffer, length)
     open(device, name, mode)
     close(device)
     control(device, function, arg1, arg2)
     init(device)
     seek(device,offset)

DESCRIPTION
     The _r_f_m and _r_f pseudo-device drivers work as a pair to pro-
     vide access to remote files using a Xinu remote file server
     across an Internet.  There is one master remote file
     pseudo-device (type _r_f_m) for a given remote server.  When
     users open the master remote file pseudo-device, they pass
     it the name of a specific file and the access mode for that
     file.  The call to OPEN(2) returns the device descriptor of
     a remote file pseudo-device (type _r_f) connected to the named
     file.

     Once opened, a user calls READ(2), WRITE(2), GETC(2), or
     PUTC(2), to transfer data between the user program and the
     remote file; they call SEEK(2) to position the file pointer.
     The user calls CLOSE(2) to disconnect from the file.
     Finally, users call CONTROL(2) on the master pseudo-device
     to test file access protections, remove files, or change
     file names.

     The standard Xinu device name for the remote file master
     pseudo-device is _R_F_I_L_S_Y_S; the standard Xinu device name for
     individual remote file pseudo-devices is _R_F_I_L_E.  The opera-
     tions on these devices are defined by:

     open(device, name, mode)
          Opens a connection to a remote file given the file name
          and access mode, and returns the device descriptor used
          to access the file.  See ACCESS(2) for valid file
          modes.

     read(device buffer, length)
          Transfers up to  _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes of data from a file to
          the user's _b_u_f_f_e_r, and returns the number of bytes
          found or _E_O_F if no more data remains in the file.

     write(device, buffer, length)

RFILSYS(4)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           RFILSYS(4)



          Writes _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes of data to a file from the user's
          _b_u_f_f_e_r.  File length extends automatically if needed.

     close(device)
          Disconnect from a file, leaving it on secondary
          storage.

     control(device, function, arg1, arg2)
          Handles file manipulation other than data transfer.
          The possible functions are:
            FLACCESS - test access (_a_r_g_1 is mode string).
            FLREMOVE - remove file named by _a_r_g_1.
            FLRENAME - rename file named by _a_r_g_1 to _a_r_g_2
            FLCLEAR - clear the remote file datagram port

     init(device)
          When called with an _r_f device, initializes the pseudo-
          device data structures at system startup.  Initializing
          the master pseudo-device has no effect.

     seek(device,offset)
          Positions the file to _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes from the beginning.
