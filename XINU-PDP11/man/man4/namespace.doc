NAMESPACE(4)        Xinu Programmer's Manual         NAMESPACE(4)



NAME
     namespace - syntactic namespace pseudo-device driver (type
     nam)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <name.h>

     open(device, name, mode)
     init(device)

DESCRIPTION
     The _n_a_m pseudo-device driver provides mapping of OPEN(2)
     calls to underlying devices based on name syntax.  The stan-
     dard Xinu name for the namespace device is _N_A_M_E_S_P_A_C_E.

     The _n_a_m driver provides two operations as follows:

     open(device,name,mode)
          Open a device given its name and access mode (see
          ACCESS(2) for an explanation of modes).

     init(device)
          Initialize the namespace by establishing a default
          interpretation for names.

NOTES
     Although system calls MOUNT(2), UNMOUNT(2), NAMMAP(2), and
     NAMREPL(2) are intricate parts of the naming system, they
     are not included in the driver simply because they do not
     fit the read/write paradigm easily.
