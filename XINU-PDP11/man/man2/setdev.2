.I Setdev
records the device ids \f2dev1\f1 and \f2dev2\f1 in the process table
entry for process \f2pid\f1 so the system will
automatically close the devices when the process exits.
It is used primarily by the shell to record the process' standard
input and standard output device ids.

close(2), kill(2)
.SH BUGS
The limit of two device ids per process is fixed, and
both must be set in a single call.
