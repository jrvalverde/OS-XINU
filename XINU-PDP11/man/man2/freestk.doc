FREESTK(2)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           FREESTK(2)



NAME
     freestk - deallocate a block of stack memory

SYNOPSIS
     int freestk(addr, len)
     char *addr;
     int len;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_r_e_e_s_t_k deallocates a contiguous block of memory previously
     obtained with GETSTK(2), and returns it to the free list.
     Argument _a_d_d_r specifies the highest integer address in the
     block being deallocated, and argument _l_e_n specifies the
     length of the block in bytes.  In this version, memory is
     allocated in  multiples of four bytes to guarantee that suf-
     ficient space is available in each block to link it onto the
     free list.  However, both _g_e_t_s_t_k and _f_r_e_e_s_t_k rounds the
     specified length automatically, so the user need not be
     aware of any extra space in the allocated blocks.
