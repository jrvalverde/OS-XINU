NAME
     psend - send a message to a port

SYNOPSIS
     int psend(portid, message)
     int portid;
     char *message;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_e_n_d adds the pointer _m_e_s_s_a_g_e to the port _p_o_r_t_i_d. If suc-
     cessful, _p_s_e_n_d returns OK; it returns SYSERR if _p_o_r_t_i_d is
     invalid.  Note that only a pointer, not the entire message,
     is enqueued, and that psend may return to the caller before
     the receiver has consumed the message.

     If the port is full at the time of the call, the sending
     process will be blocked until space is available in the port
     for the message.
