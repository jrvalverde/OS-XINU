NAME
     getbuf - obtain a buffer from a buffer pool

SYNOPSIS
     char *getbuf(poolid)
     int poolid;

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_b_u_f obtains a free buffer from the pool given by argument
     _p_o_o_l_i_d, and returns a pointer to the first word of the
     buffer.  If all buffers in the specified pool are in use,
     the calling process will be blocked until a buffer becomes
     available.  If the argument _p_o_o_l_i_d does not specify a valid
     pool, getbuf returns SYSERR.
