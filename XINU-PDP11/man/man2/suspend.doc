NAME
     suspend - suspend a process to keep it from executing

SYNOPSIS
     int suspend(pid)
     int pid;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_u_s_p_e_n_d places process _p_i_d in a state of hibernation.  If
     _p_i_d is illegal, or the process is not currently running or
     on the ready list, _s_u_s_p_e_n_d returns SYSERR.  Otherwise it
     returns the priority of the suspended process.  A process
     may suspend itself, in which case the call returns the
     priority at which the process is resumed.

     Note that hibernation differs from sleeping because a hiber-
     nating process can remain on I/O or semaphore queues.  A
     process can put another into hibernation; a process can only
     put itself to sleep.
