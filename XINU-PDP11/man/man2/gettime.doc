GETTIME(2)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           GETTIME(2)



NAME
     gettime - obtain the current local time in seconds past the
     epoch date

SYNOPSIS
     int gettime(timvar)
     long *timvar;

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_t_i_m_e obtains the local time measured in seconds past the
     epoch date, and places it in the longword pointed to by
     argument _t_i_m_v_a_r.  The epoch is taken to be zero seconds past
     Jan 1, 1970.

     The correct time is usually kept by the real-time clock, but
     _g_e_t_t_i_m_e  may contact a time server on the network if the
     local time has not been initialized.

     If _g_e_t_t_i_m_e cannot obtain the current time, it returns SYSERR
     to the caller.  Otherwise, _g_e_t_t_i_m_e returns OK.

BUGS
     Local time computation does not take daylight savings into
     account.  The local clock may drift, especially under heavy
     CPU activity or activities that require the operating system
     to mask interrupts for extended periods.
