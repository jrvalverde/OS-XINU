FREEMEM(2)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           FREEMEM(2)



NAME
     freemem - deallocate a block of heap memory

SYNOPSIS
     int freemem(addr, len)
     char *addr;
     int len;

DESCRIPTION
     _F_r_e_e_m_e_m deallocates a contiguous block of memory previously
     obtained with GETMEM(2), and returns it to the free list.
     Argument _a_d_d_r specifies the lowest address of the block
     being deallocated, and argument _l_e_n specifies the length of
     the block in bytes.  In this version, memory is allocated in
     multiples of four bytes to guarantee that sufficient space
     is available in each block to link it onto the free list.
     However, the length passed to both _g_e_t_m_e_m and _f_r_e_e_m_e_m is
     rounded automatically, so the user need not be aware of any
     extra space in the allocated block.
