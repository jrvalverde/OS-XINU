NAME
     preceive - get a message from a port

SYNOPSIS
     char *preceive(portid)
     int portid;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_r_e_c_e_i_v_e retrieves the next message from the port _p_o_r_t_i_d,
     returning a pointer to the message if successful, or SYSERR
     if _p_o_r_t_i_d is invalid.  (The sender and receiver must agree
     on a convention for passing the message length.)

     The calling process is blocked if there are no messages
     available (and reawakened as soon as a message arrives).
     The only ways to be released from a port queue are for some
     other process to send a message to the port with PSEND(2) or
     for some other process to delete or reset the port with
     PDELETE(2) or PRESET(2).
