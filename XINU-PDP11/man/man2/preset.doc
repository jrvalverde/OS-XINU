NAME
     preset  - reset a port

SYNOPSIS
     int preset(portid, dispose)
     int portid;
     int (*dispose)();

DESCRIPTION
     _P_r_e_s_e_t flushes all messages from a port and releases all
     processes waiting to send or receive messages.  _P_r_e_s_e_t
     returns SYSERR if _p_o_r_t_i_d is not a valid port id.

     _P_r_e_s_e_t has several effects, depending on the state of the
     port at the time the call is issued.  If processes are
     blocked waiting to receive messages from port _p_o_r_t_i_d, they
     are all made ready; each returns SYSERR to caller.  If mes-
     sages are in the port they are disposed of by passing them
     to function _d_i_s_p_o_s_e.  If process are blocked waiting to send
     messages they are made ready; each returns SYSERR to its
     caller (as though the port never existed).

     The effects of _p_r_e_s_e_t are the same as PDELETE(2) followed by
     PCREATE(2), except that the port is not deallocated.  The
     maximum message count remains the same as it was.

BUGS
     There is no way to change the maximum message count when the
     port is reset.
