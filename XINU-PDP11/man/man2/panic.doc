PANIC(2)            Xinu Programmer's Manual             PANIC(2)



NAME
     panic - abort processing due to severe error

SYNOPSIS
     int panic(message)
     char *message;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_a_n_i_c will print the character string _m_e_s_s_a_g_e on the con-
     sole, dump the machine registers and top few stack loca-
     tions, and halt the processor.  It uses _k_p_r_i_n_t_f rather than
     _p_r_i_n_t_f, so it may be called anywhere in the kernel (e.g.,
     from an interrupt routine that may be executed by the null
     process).  Typing P after the processor halts will cause
     panic to restore the machine state and continue, so it is
     possible to examine locations with ODT after the processor
     halts, and still restart processing.

     There are alternate entry points to _p_a_n_i_c that are invoked
     by branch to location zero, illegal interrupts, or processor
     exceptions (traps).
