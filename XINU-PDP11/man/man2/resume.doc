NAME
     resume - resume a suspended process

SYNOPSIS
     int resume(pid)
     int pid;

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_s_u_m_e takes process _p_i_d out of hibernation and allows it to
     resume execution.  If _p_i_d is invalid or process _p_i_d is not
     suspended, _r_e_s_u_m_e returns SYSERR; otherwise it returns the
     priority at which the process resumed execution.  Only
     suspended processes may be resumed.
