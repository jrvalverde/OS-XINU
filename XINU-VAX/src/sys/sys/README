	This file is {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys/README

This directory contains the source programs for Xinu itself.  To rebuild
Xinu, edit file "Configuration" to reflect the hardware on your VAX,
and run make.  Typically, "make d" is used to make new Xinu object files,
link them into a library (libx.a), compile source program "test.c",
download the result, and invoke odt to see the output.  When you are
satisfied that it works, run "make everything" to produce miscellaneous
files like ",lint" and ",sizes" (a sample output from "make everything"
has been left in file make.out so you can see what to expect).

Finally, to make the new version public, run "make install" which actually
copies "xinu.o" and "libx.a" into {Xinu-directory}/lib where they can be
accessed by /bin/cc or /bin/ld.

 Note1:	The make file has been carefully constructed so it references
	xinu.o and libx.a in THIS directory when it compiles and links
	the test program.
