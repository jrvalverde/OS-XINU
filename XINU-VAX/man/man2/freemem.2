.TH FREEMEM 2
.SH NAME
freemem \- deallocate a block of heap memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B int freemem(addr, len)
.B char *addr;
.B int len;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Freemem
deallocates a contiguous block of memory
previously obtained with GETMEM(2),
and returns it to the free list.
Argument \f2addr\f1 specifies the lowest address
of the block being deallocated, and argument \f2len\f1 specifies the
length of the block in bytes.
In this version, memory is allocated in  multiples of four bytes to guarantee
that sufficient space is available in each block to link it onto the free
list.
However, the length passed to both \f2getmem\f1 and \f2freemem\f1 is
rounded automatically, so the user need not be aware of any extra space in
the allocated block.
