     _B_u_s_e_r_s lists the users who hold reservations on all backend
     machines.  Each line of output contains the machine name,
     the class the machine belongs to, the user who holds it, and
     the idle time.  Reservations are made by _o_d_t(1), and _d_o_w_n_-
     _l_o_a_d(1).

     _B_u_s_e_r_s lists reservations and idle time based on lock file
     times which may not be quite accurate.  Machines with more
     than 10 minutes of idle time are listed even though the
     reservation software considers the reservation to have
     expired.
