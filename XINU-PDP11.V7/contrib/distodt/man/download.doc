     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d takes an absolute binary program image (SUN a.out
     format) and copies it to the frontend file /_t_f_t_p_b_o_o_t/_a._o_u_t
     for the backend sun to use when booting.  _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d deter-
     mines which backend SUN the user has reserved, or finds a
     free backend SUN if the user does not have a backend SUN
     reserved.  Once a backend is found, _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d uses TCP to
     send the binary program image to the associated front end.
     Note that local net broadcasts are used to find free backend
     SUNs so downloading is only allowed to SUNs connected to the
     local net.

     Loading the object program takes time proportional to the
     size of the program itself.  In two seconds, download will
     transfer about 56K bytes over the ethernet using TCP.

     _D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d transfers the user's program as specified in the
     command line.  If no program name is given, _a._o_u_t is used.

     Options are:

     ----cccc_C_L_A_S_S
          Class.  Use a machine in the class _C_L_A_S_S. The default
          class is SUN.  If the user already has a backend
          reserved in class _C_L_A_S_S, then it will be used.  If the
          user already has a backend reserved, but it is in a
          different class, then it will be released before a new
          one is reserved.  If no machines are available in class
          _C_L_A_S_S a message indicating this will be printed.  See
          also _b_u_s_e_r_s, which displays which class each backend
          machine belongs to.

     ----mmmm_M_A_C_H
          Machine.  Use the backend machine named _M_A_C_H if it is
          available.  If the user already has a different machine
          reserved, it will be released before the new machine
          _M_A_C_H is reserved.

     you will be able to download from anything to anything.
