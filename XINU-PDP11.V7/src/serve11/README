	This is file README in {Xinu-directory}/src/serve11.

The serve11 source direcotry contains the source code for a stand-alone
RARP/Time/Name/File server that can be used to boot version 7 Xinu.
Naturally, serve11 is a hacked version of Xinu itself with the servers
added and enough commands removed to make space for them.  The source
directory here duplicates many files found in the standard system source
directory because we took a snapshot one day and worked from it -- you
should assume that the latest versions of files are found in the Xinu
system source directory and not here.

When built, the PDP-11 a.out file for the standalone server is called
serve11 and is installed in {Xinu-directory}/lib/serve11.
