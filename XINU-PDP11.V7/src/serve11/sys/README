This directory contains the source for the serve11 program that allows
an LSI 11 to supply RARP, time, file, and domain name "servers".  By
dedicating one LSI 11 to running serve11, it is possible to experiment
with Xinu networking even if the site does not have an Internet network
address and doesn not run the standard servers from 4.3 BSD UNIX.
