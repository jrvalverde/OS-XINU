The files in this directory are, with few exceptions,
identical to those in the (non-portable) pdp11 c compiler directory.

The exceptions are:
	c0.h		changed to include #ifdef vax

	c10.c, c12.c	minor fixes of archaic C usage

	cvopt		changed to output equivalent, but
			more similar to vax, assembly language

	Makefile	changed to include the pipeline
			cvopt <table.s | sed -f sedscript >table.i
			which converts 11 assembler-dependent
			constructs to vax assembler constructs

The vax C compiler does a lot of complaining when it compiles
these files, due to non-fatal archaic C usage that I was too
lazy to clean up.

The whole directory should work as is on the 11, except
that"sedscript" should be a no-op.
