This directory contains all VAX specific downloader code
including the code that executes on the UNIX machine VAX when
downloading to a VAX as well as the code that executes on the
VAX for bootstrap, serial line downloading, and ethernet
downloading.

The Makefile included here is to allow the Makefile in the parent
directory to remake and install things without knowing the structure
of lower-level directories.
