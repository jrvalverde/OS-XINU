NAME
     upload - copy LSI 11 memory to VAX

SYNOPSIS
     upload [ options ] ...  [ [ min addr ] max addr ]

DESCRIPTION
     _U_p_l_o_a_d copies the contents of an LSI 11 memory onto a file
     on the VAX.  By default the image is placed in file core11.

     Arguments _m_i_n _a_d_d_r and _m_a_x _a_d_d_r limit the image to specific
     addresses.

     Options include the following:

     -o   Output file.  Take the next argument as an output file
          name in place of _c_o_r_e_1_1.

     -v   Verbose. Print the details of communications between
          the LSI 11 and the host.

     -s   Silent. Print no information messages.

     -n   Noload.  Assume the uploader code is already resident
          in the LSI 11.

     -lx  LSI number.  Use LSI number _x for uploading.  If this
          option is not specified, _u_p_l_o_a_d selects the LSI 11 that
          the user has reserved.

     -a   a.out file.  Take the next argument as the name of the
          object file in place of a.out.

     -cL  Use LSI in class _L.

FILES

     Note: files for other machines have ``lsi'' replaced by the
     machine type.

BUGS
     _U_p_l_o_a_d reads the contents of some memory locations with ODT
     and then overwrites them with a bootstrap program; if
     aborted, it cannot be restarted because data has been lost.
