DD58(1)             Xinu Programmer's Manual              DD58(1)



NAME
     dd58 - copy a file to or from a TU58 connected to an asyn-
     chronous VAX line

SYNOPSIS
     dd58 [option[=value]] ...

DESCRIPTION
     The TU58 tape drive is a block-addressable, random access
     cartridge tape storage unit often used with LSI 11 microcom-
     puters.  The program _d_d_5_8 provides a way to write TU58 tapes
     from the VAX (e.g., to create a bootable system tape).  It
     copies standard input to the TU58, or a given number of
     blocks from the TU58 to its standard output.  Because the
     TU58 controller is a block-oriented interface that relies on
     the driver to supply data quickly, one should never use a
     terminal as standard input.  Options are:

     _o_p_t_i_o_n         _v_a_l_u_e_s
     sam            set special addressing mode
     -sam           disable special addressing mode (default)
     verify         check data after reading or writing (default)
     -verify        do not check data after reading or writing
     maint          set maintenance mode
     -maint         disable maintenance mode (default)
     drive=_n        use drive number _n (default 0)
     posit=_n        reading or writing begins with tape block _n
                    (default 0)
     count=_n        read or write _n bytes (default for _w_r_i_t_i_n_g is
                    to end of file; this must be specified for
                    reading)
     _r_e_a_d           read from the TU58 and write to the standard
                    output
     _w_r_i_t_e          read from the standard input and write to the
                    TU58
     _s_e_e_k           position the TU58 drive at the given block
                    number

     For example, to put the file _x on a tape cartridge at block
     31, using special address mode, use


          dd58 sam posit=31 write < x

     To read its first 512 bytes into the file _y, use


          dd58 sam posit=31 count=512 read > y

DIAGNOSTICS
     Error messages are printed on the terminal; they are self-
     explanatory.
