NAME
     lorder11 - find ordering relation for an LSI 11 object
     library

SYNOPSIS
     lorder11 file ...

DESCRIPTION
     Argument _f_i_l_e is the input consisting of one or more object
     files or library archives (see _a_r(1)).  The standard output
     is a list of pairs of object file names, meaning that the
     first file of the pair refers to external identifiers
     defined in the second.  The output may be processed by UNIX
     _t_s_o_r_t to find an ordering of a library suitable for one-pass
     access by _l_d_1_1(1).

     This brash one-liner intends to build a new library from
     existing `.o' files.

          ar cr library `lorder11 *.o | tsort`

     The need for lorder11 is eliminated by _r_a_n_l_i_b_1_1(1), which
     converts an ordered archive into a randomly accessed
     library.

FILES
     *symref, *symdef
     nm11(1), sed(1), sort(1), join(1)

SEE ALSO
     tsort(1), ld11(1), ar(1), ranlib11(1)

BUGS
     The names of object files, in and out of libraries, must end
     with `.o'; nonsense results otherwise.
