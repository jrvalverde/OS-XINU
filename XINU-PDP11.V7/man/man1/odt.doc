ODT(1)              Xinu Programmer's Manual               ODT(1)



NAME
     odt - connect user's terminal to a micro console (odt) line

SYNOPSIS
     odt [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _O_d_t connects a terminal on the VAX to a microcomputer tty
     line so the output of the micro appears on the terminal
     screen and characters typed at the keyboard are sent to the
     micro.  _O_d_t sets the micro tty line to raw mode, and the VAX
     terminal to cbreak mode.  The connection can be broken by
     killing the odt process (e.g., by typing the interrupt char-
     acter (e.g., CONTROL-C).

     When _o_d_t receives a backslash from the terminal, it switches
     to raw mode to read one character, after which it switches
     back to cbreak mode.  The backslash escape allows the user
     to send characters like CONTROL-C to the micro even though
     they are normally interpreted as signals.  As a special
     case, an escaped null character (octal 0) causes _o_d_t to
     force the micro line into a break condition for 1 second.
     This is useful for trapping an LSI 11 into ODT mode.

     Options are:

     -lx  Connect to machine number _x. If this option is not
          specified, download selects the LSI-11 that the user
          has on reserve, or a free one if none is reserved.
          E.g., -l9.

     -cL  Use LSI in class L (as specified in the _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s data-
          base).

     -BX  Use Baudrate _X in communicating with the LSI console.

     -h   Hold the LSI, so multiple machines may be allocated to
          one user.

     -T[x]
          Release LSI after _x minutes of idle time.  If no value
          for _x is listed, the LSI will be held indefinitely.
          The default timeout value is set in the _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s data-
          base.

     -f   Turn off X-ON X-OFF flow control.  Flow control is on
          by default.
