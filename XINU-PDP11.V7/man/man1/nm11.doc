NAME
     nm11 - print name list for object file produced by cc11

SYNOPSIS
     nm11 [ -agnopru ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_m_1_1 prints the name list (symbol table) of each object _f_i_l_e
     in the argument list.  If no _f_i_l_e is given, the symbols in
     `a.out' are listed.

     Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if unde-
     fined) and one of the letters U (undefined), A (absolute), T
     (text segment symbol), D (data segment symbol), B (bss seg-
     ment symbol), C (common symbol), or f file name.  If the
     symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower
     case.  The output is sorted alphabetically.

     Options are:

     -a   Include all symbols in candidates for printing; nor-
          mally symbols destined for UNIX's _s_d_b(1) are excluded.

     -g   Print only global (external) symbols.

     -n   Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

     -o   Prepend file or archive element name to each output
          line rather than only once.

     -p   Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.

     -r   Sort in reverse order.

     -u   Print only undefined symbols.
