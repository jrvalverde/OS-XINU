HALT(3)             Xinu Programmer's Manual              HALT(3)



NAME
     halt, pause - pause or halt the processor

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kernel.h>

     halt();
     pause();

DESCRIPTION
     _H_a_l_t stops the processor immediately without affecting dev-
     ices or direct-memory-access (DMA) operations on the bus.
     Once halted, the processor will not respond to interrupts.
     _H_a_l_t is useful for debugging the operating system.

     _P_a_u_s_e stops the processor until an interrupt occurs, allow-
     ing it to continue at the instruction following the _p_a_u_s_e
     when the interrupt returns.  _P_a_u_s_e is used in the null pro-
     cess instead of an infinite loop to avoid taking bus
     bandwidth needlessly.

     In the current implementation, both _h_a_l_t and _p_a_u_s_e are mac-
     ros that expand to the assembler language _h_a_l_t and _p_a_u_s_e
     instructions.  Thus, they can only be executed in kernel
     mode.
