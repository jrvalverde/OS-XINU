DISABLE(3)          Xinu Programmer's Manual           DISABLE(3)



NAME
     disable, enable, restore - change and restore processor
     interrupt status

SYNOPSIS
     disable(ps);
     enable(ps);
     restore(ps);

     char ps;

DESCRIPTION
     These routines change the processor interrupt status mode.
     Normally, procedures use _d_i_s_a_b_l_e and _r_e_s_t_o_r_e to save the
     interrupt status, mask interrupts off, and then restore the
     saved status.  _E_n_a_b_l_e explicitly enables interrupts; it is
     used only at system startup.

SEE ALSO
     cvt(1)

BUGS
     In this implementation, _d_i_s_a_b_l_e and _r_e_s_t_o_r_e are macros that
     must have local variable _p_s as an argument, and must use
     CVT(1) to convert the assembler code they produce to legal
     assembler.
