NAME
     signal, signaln - signal a semaphore

SYNOPSIS
     int signal(sem)
     int signaln(sem, count)
     int sem;
     int count;

DESCRIPTION
     In either form, _s_i_g_n_a_l signals semaphore _s_e_m and returns
     SYSERR if the semaphore does not exist, OK otherwise.  The
     form _s_i_g_n_a_l increments the count of _s_e_m by 1 and frees the
     next process if any are waiting.  The form _s_i_g_n_a_l_n incre-
     ments the semaphore by _c_o_u_n_t and frees up to _c_o_u_n_t processes
     if that many are waiting.  Note that _s_i_g_n_a_l_n(sem, x) is
     equivalent to executing _s_i_g_n_a_l(sem) x times.
