NAME
     seek - device independent position seeking routine

SYNOPSIS
     int seek(dev, position)
     int dev;
     char *buffer;
     long position;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_e_e_k will position the device given by _d_e_v after the _p_o_s_i_-
     _t_i_o_n byte.  It returns SYSERR if _d_e_v is incorrect, or if it
     is not possible to position _d_e_v as specified.

     _S_e_e_k cannot be used with devices connected to terminals.

     Note that the position argument is declared _l_o_n_g rather than
     _i_n_t.
