NAME
     nammap - map a name through the syntactic namespace

SYNOPSIS
     int nammap(name, newname)
     char *name;
     char *newname;

DESCRIPTION
     _N_a_m_m_a_p uses the syntactic namespace to translate a name into
     a new name and returns the id of a device to which the name
     maps.  Names are mapped iteratively until they map to a dev-
     ice other than the _N_A_M_E_S_P_A_C_E.

     Argument _n_a_m_e points to a null-terminated string containing
     the name to be mapped.  Argument _n_e_w_n_a_m_e points to a string
     area large enough to hold the mapped version of the name.
     If successful, _n_a_m_m_a_p returns the device id of the device to
     which the mapping corresponds.  Otherwise, it returns
     SYSERR.

SEE ALSO
     namrepl(2), open(2), mount(2), unmount(2), namespace(4)

BUGS
     _N_a_m_m_a_p writes the mapped name into _n_e_w_n_a_m_e without checking
     to make sure it fits.  There is no way to distinguish errors
     such as string overflow from names that map to device
     SYSERR.
