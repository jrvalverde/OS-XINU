NAME
     putc - device independent character output routine

SYNOPSIS
     int putc(dev, ch)
     int dev;
     char ch;

DESCRIPTION
     _P_u_t_c will write the character _c_h on the I/O device given by
     _d_e_v. It returns SYSERR if _d_e_v is incorrect, OK otherwise.

     By convention, _p_r_i_n_t_f calls _p_u_t_c on device CONSOLE to write
     formatted output.  Usually CONSOLE is device zero.
