NAME
     getc - device independent character input routine

SYNOPSIS
     int getc(dev)
     int dev;

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_c will read the next character from the I/O device given
     by _d_e_v. It returns SYSERR if _d_e_v is incorrect.  A successful
     call may return a character (widened to an integer) or the
     value EOF to denote end of file, depending on the device
     driver.

SEE ALSO
     close(2), control(2), open(2), putc(2), read(2), seek(2),
     write(2)

BUGS
     Not all devices report the end-of-file condition.
