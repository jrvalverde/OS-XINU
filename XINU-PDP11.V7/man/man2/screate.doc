NAME
     screate - create a new semaphore

SYNOPSIS
     int screate(count)
     int count;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_r_e_a_t_e creates a counting semaphore and initializes it to
     _c_o_u_n_t. If successful, _s_c_r_e_a_t_e returns the integer identifier
     of the new semaphore.  It returns SYSERR if no more sema-
     phores can be allocated or if _c_o_u_n_t is less than zero.

     Semaphores are manipulated with WAIT(2) and SIGNAL(2) to
     synchronize processes.  Waiting causes the semaphore count
     to be decremented; decrementing a semaphore count past zero
     causes a process to be blocked.  Signaling a semaphore
     increases its count, freeing a blocked process if one is
     waiting.
