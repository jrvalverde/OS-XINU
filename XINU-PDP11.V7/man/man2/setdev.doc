NAME
     setdev - set the standard input and output device ids for a
     process

SYNOPSIS
     int setdev(pid, dev1, dev2)
     int pid;
     int dev1;
     int dev2;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_e_t_d_e_v records the device ids _d_e_v_1 and _d_e_v_2 in the process
     table entry for process _p_i_d so the system will automatically
     close the devices when the process exits.  It is used pri-
     marily by the shell to record the process' standard input
     and standard output device ids.

SEE ALSO
     close(2), kill(2)

BUGS
     The limit of two device ids per process is fixed, and both
     must be set in a single call.
