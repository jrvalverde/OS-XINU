NAME
     unsleep - remove a sleeping process from the clock queue
     prematurely

SYNOPSIS
     int unsleep(pid)
     int pid;

DESCRIPTION
     _U_n_s_l_e_e_p allow one process to take another out of the sleep-
     ing state before the time limit has expired.  usually, only
     system routines like RECVTIM(2) and KILL(2) call _u_n_s_l_e_e_p.
     User-level processes can avoid using _u_n_s_l_e_e_p by arranging
     processes to cooperate using message passing primitives.

SEE ALSO
     sleep(2), kill(2), recvtim(2)
