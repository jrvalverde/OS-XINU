NAME
     getutim - obtain current universal time in seconds past the
     epoch

SYNOPSIS
     int getutim(timvar)
     long *timvar;

DESCRIPTION
     _G_e_t_u_t_i_m obtains the current time measured in seconds past
     the epoch date, and places it in the longword pointed to by
     argument _t_i_m_v_a_r.  The correct time is usually kept by the
     real-time clock, but _g_e_t_t_i_m_e  may contact a time server on
     the network if the local time has not been initialized.

     The epoch is taken to be zero seconds past Jan 1, 1970.
     Universal time, formerly called Greenwich Mean Time, is the
     mean solar time of the meridian in Greenwich, England, and
     is used throughout the world as a standard for measuring
     time.

     If _g_e_t_u_t_i_m cannot obtain the current time, it returns SYSERR
     to the caller.  Otherwise, _g_e_t_u_t_i_m returns OK.

BUGS
     The local clock may drift, especially under heavy CPU
     activity or activities that require the operating system to
     mask interrupts for extended periods.
