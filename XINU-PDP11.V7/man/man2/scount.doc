NAME
     scount - return the count associated with a semaphore

SYNOPSIS
     int scount(sem)
     int sem;

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_o_u_n_t returns the current count associated with semaphore
     _s_e_m. A count of negative p means that there are p processes
     waiting on the semaphore; a count of positive p means that
     at most p more calls to WAIT(2) can occur before a process
     will be blocked (assuming no intervening sends occur).

SEE ALSO
     screate(2), sdelete(2), signal(2), sreset(2), wait(2)

BUGS
     In this version, there is no way to distinguish SYSERR from
     a legal semaphore count of -1.
