# This is the database that contains information about the
# microcomputers available for running Xinu.  The file describes
# machine hardware, domain names, and classes (groups) of machines,
# as well as the physical tty lines and downloader to use.
#
# Part 1: tty lines and machines to which they connect.  The
#	  Ethernet downloader is usually edl.XXX, where XXX
#	  gives the machine type.  Internet addresses in dotted
#	  decimal notation can be substituted for domain names.

# Part 2: class names and tty to which they correspond.  Note that
#	  it is possible to put a physical machine in multiple
#	  classes, so in the example, machine 8 in class LSI is
#	  the same as machine 1 in class SERVE11.
